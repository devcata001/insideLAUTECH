# Dashboard and Order Management Fixes - March 30, 2026

## Summary of Changes

All requested features have been successfully implemented to enhance the dashboard and order management system.

---

## 1. **Spacing Between Dashboard Cards** ✅

### Issue

Total Orders and Orders/Shop Now cards were too close together.

### Fix

- Changed grid gap from `g-3` to `g-4` in dashboard.html
- This adds more breathing room between the stat cards
- File: `/pages/dashboard.html` (Line ~157)

### Result

```html
<div class="row g-4 mb-4"><!-- Changed from g-3 to g-4 --></div>
```

---

## 2. **Create Account Button Not Working** ✅

### Issues Identified & Fixed

1. Improved form detection to handle both `#signupForm` and `.auth-form` selectors
2. Added better error handling and logging
3. Improved timeout for redirect (1500ms instead of 1200ms)
4. Enhanced form validation feedback

### Changes Made

- **File**: `/js/script.js`
- Updated `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to:
  - Use fallback selector: `form#signupForm, form.auth-form`
  - Add debugging for form detection
  - Prevent default form submission explicitly
  - Improved error messages

### Result

Form submission now properly triggers the `signUp()` function with validation and redirects to login on success.

---

## 3. **Total Orders Updates Immediately After Payment** ✅

### Implementation

Added complete order management system that automatically creates orders on successful payment.

### Key Functions Added to `main.js`

#### A. `generateDeliveryCode()`

```javascript
// Generates a random 4-digit code for delivery confirmation
const code = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000).padStart(4, "0");
```

#### B. `createOrder(items, total, userId, userName, userEmail, paymentRef)`

- Creates order object with all details
- Generates unique order ID: `ORD-{timestamp}`
- Generates random 4-digit delivery code
- Stores order in localStorage under `shoponcampus_orders`
- Returns the created order

### Integration in Cart

- **File**: `/pages/cart.html`
- Updated `checkout()` function to call `createOrder()` on successful payment
- Passes cart items, total amount, user info, and payment reference
- Orders are immediately stored in localStorage

### Workflow

1. User completes payment via Paystack
2. `onSuccess` callback fires
3. `createOrder()` is called with cart details
4. Order is stored in localStorage
5. User is redirected to dashboard
6. Dashboard displays updated order count

---

## 4. **View Orders and Receipts** ✅

### Dashboard Updates

- **File**: `/pages/dashboard.html`
- Added `ordersContainer` div to display order list
- Replaces static "No orders yet" message with dynamic order display

- Filters orders for current logged-in user
- Displays order list with:
  - Order ID and date
  - Item count and names

```

#### B. `viewReceipt(orderId)`

- Displays:
  - Order ID and timestamp
  - Itemized list with prices and quantities

  - **Prominent delivery confirmation code (4-digit)**

#### C. `printReceipt(button)`

---

## 5. **Random 4-Digit Delivery Confirmation Code** ✅

### Implementation Details

#### A. Code Generation

```javascript
const generateDeliveryCode = () => {
  return String(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)).padStart(4, "0");
};
// Examples: 0001, 0542, 9999, 4738
```

#### B. Code Display Locations

1. **Order List** (Dashboard > Orders)
   - Blue alert box with delivery code
   - Message: "Show this code on delivery confirmation"

2. **Receipt Modal**
   - Separate alert section
   - Large, bold display
   - Instructions for showing to delivery person

#### C. Storage

---

## 6. **Updated Order Management Data Structure**

### Order Object Schema

```javascript
{
    orderId: "ORD-1711810231234",           // Unique identifier
    userId: "user@email.com",               // User's email
    userName: "User Full Name",             // User's name
    items: [                                // Array of purchased items
        {
            id: 1,
            name: "Product Name",
            price: 5000,
            quantity: 1,
            category: "textbooks"
        }
    ],
    total: 5500,                           // Total with delivery fee
    paymentRef: "INSIDE-1711810231234",    // Payment reference
    deliveryCode: "7284",                  // 4-digit confirmation code
    status: "pending",                     // pending, delivered, etc.
    createdAt: "2026-03-30T...",          // ISO timestamp
    deliveredAt: null                      // Will be set on delivery
}
```

### LocalStorage Keys

- `shoponcampus_orders` - Array of all orders in system
- Filtered by user email at runtime on dashboard
