## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Dashboard Card Spacing** - FIXED

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What was changed**:

- File: `/pages/dashboard.html` (Line ~157)
- Changed: `<div class="row g-3 mb-4">`
- To: `<div class="row g-4 mb-4">`
- Increased Bootstrap grid gap from 3 to 4 for better spacing

**Result**:

- Visual space now between "Total Orders" and "Shop Now" cards
- Cards have proper breathing room
- Better visual hierarchy

---

### 2. **Create Account Button** - FIXED

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What was changed**:

- File: `/js/script.js` (DOMContentLoaded & form handling)
- Improved form selector to: `form#signupForm, form.auth-form`
- Added explicit `event.preventDefault()` in form listener
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Better feedback messages
- Increased redirect timeout for better UX

**Changes Made**:

```javascript
// Before
form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => signUp(event, formElements));

// After - More robust
form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  signUp(event, formElements);
});
```

**Result**:

- Form now properly detects and submits
- Validates all fields with clear error messages
- Redirects to login on successful signup
- Better error logging for debugging

### 3. **Total Orders Updates After Payment** - FIXED

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What was added**:

- File: `/pages/cart.html` (checkout function)
- File: `/js/main.js` (order creation functions)

**New Functions**:

```javascript
createOrder(items, total, userId, userName, userEmail, paymentRef);
generateDeliveryCode();
```

**Workflow**:

1. User completes payment via Paystack ✓
2. `onSuccess` callback triggers ✓
3. Immediately calls `createOrder()` ✓
4. Order stored in localStorage['shoponcampus_orders'] ✓
5. Cart cleared ✓
6. User redirected to dashboard ✓
7. Dashboard displays updated Total Orders count ✓

**Code Integration**:

```javascript
// In cart.html checkout function
onSuccess: (response) => {
  showToast(
    `Payment successful! Total: ₦${totalAmount.toLocaleString()}`,
    "success",
  );

  // THIS CREATES THE ORDER IMMEDIATELY
  createOrder(
    cartItemsCopy,
    totalAmount,
    user.email,
    user.name,
    user.email,
    paymentReference,
  );

  cart = [];
  localStorage.setItem("shoponcampus_cart", JSON.stringify(cart));
  updateCartCount();
  renderCart();
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = "dashboard.html";
  }, 1300);
};
```

**Result**:

- Orders created automatically on payment success
- Immediately visible on dashboard
- Total Orders count updates in real-time
- Order data persists in localStorage

**Code Generation**:

```javascript
const generateDeliveryCode = () => {
  const code = String(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)).padStart(4, "0");
  return code;
};
// Generates: 0001, 5432, 9999, 0500, etc.
